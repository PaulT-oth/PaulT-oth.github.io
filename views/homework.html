        <h2>Acyl-CoA molecules in a cell are used based on the current energy level. A cell in a high energy state system will have insulin signaling active, thereby allowing more glucose to enter the cell through Glut4. This will lead to an increase in the flux of glycolysis and TCA, and more substrate can be diverted to fatty acid synthesis.  This means that more acyl-CoA molecules will be present in the cells, but they won’t be able to be utilized in β-Ox. Malonyl-CoA, a FAS precursor, competitively and allosterically inhibits the first step of β-Ox CPT1. This means that the acyl-CoA molecules are available for use in synthesizing new phosphatidylcholine molecules. In a low energy system, a cell will be expressing AMPK to prevent anabolic processes from occurring, while simultaneously promoting catabolic ones. Regarding acyl-CoA use, AMPK phosphorylates ACC1 and 2 inactivating them. These are the enzymes which produce malonyl-CoA for FAS, with ACC2 being primarily responsible for CPT1 inhibition. With CPT1 again active acyl-CoA molecules can be imported into the mitochondria to undergo β-Ox. This means that they not only will be unavailable for lipid synthesis, but phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CTP) of the Kennedy pathway will not be running since FA containing compounds activate it.</h2>
